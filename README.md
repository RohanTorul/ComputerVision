# Instructions:
- activate venv, get the packages and whatnot
- run a simulation test script, there's goundtest and ir_groundtest currently.
- open OBS, record the window, then activate virtual camera
- open the detection script relevant for the test
- make sure you got the right camera selected(should be either 1 or 2 but could be anything really just keep incrementing from 0 until you get it)
- voila
